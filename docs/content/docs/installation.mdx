  You'll need a Next.js project with Drizzle ORM and Postgres already set up.
</Callout>

## Quick Start with Init Command

The fastest way to get started is to use the init command, which will install all dependencies automatically:

```bash
npm install -g corsair
pnpm corsair init
```

The init command will guide you through setup and install all required packages.

## Manual Installation (Optional)

If you prefer to install packages manually, follow these steps:

### Install Corsair

```bash
npm install corsair
```

### Install Required Dependencies

Corsair requires several peer dependencies for full functionality:

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/tanstack-react-query
npm install drizzle-orm drizzle-zod zod superjson dotenv server-only
```

### Install Dev Dependencies

```bash
npm install -D drizzle-kit typescript tsx
```

### Database Setup

Make sure you have a Postgres database running and configured. Install the Postgres client:

```bash
npm install pg
npm install -D @types/pg
```

## Initialize Your Project

After installing dependencies, run the init command to set up your project structure:

```bash
pnpm corsair init
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup and create all necessary files and folders.

  After initialization, you can start creating queries and mutations with `pnpm corsair query` and `pnpm corsair mutation`. See the CLI guide for more details.

<Callout title="What is Corsair?" type="info">
  Corsair lets you write database queries and business logic in plain English. 
  It generates real TypeScript API routes using your existing ORM—no magic, no vendor lock-in, no runtime overhead.
</Callout>

## Why Corsair?

We have great AI coding tools for building UIs. But what about the other two tiers of your app: 
business logic and databases? Corsair fills that gap.

### You stay in control

- **Real code, not abstraction** - Corsair generates standard TypeScript API routes. View them, edit them, own them.
- **Zero runtime overhead** - Code generation happens at build time. Your queries run at normal API speeds.
- **Fully type-safe** - Your prompts map to input/output types. TypeScript knows exactly what you're sending and receiving.
- **Schema-aware** - Change your Drizzle schema? Corsair detects affected routes and rewrites them automatically.
- **Incremental adoption** - Use Corsair alongside your existing API routes. No need to rewrite your app.
- **No vendor lock-in** - Your queries are stored as normal TypeScript. Want to eject? Just move the generated routes.

## Features

- tRPC-based router with superjson for serialization
- TanStack Query integration for client-side data fetching
- Next.js App Router adapter with streaming support
- CLI for code generation, validation, and migrations
- Drizzle ORM + Postgres support
- Plugin system (Slack, Stripe, Posthog, Resend)
- Built for AI coding agents (Claude, Cursor)

## How it works

1. **You write:** `useCorsairQuery("get all albums by artist id", {artistId})`
2. **Corsair generates:** A complete TypeScript API route using your Drizzle ORM
3. **You get:** Type-safe queries with intellisense, no SQL required
4. **Schema changes?** Corsair sees the diff and updates affected routes

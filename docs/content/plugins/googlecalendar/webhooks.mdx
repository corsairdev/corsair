The Google Calendar plugin automatically handles incoming webhooks from Google Calendar. Configure Google Calendar push notifications to receive real-time updates when events change.

**New to Corsair?** Learn about core concepts like [webhooks](/concepts/webhooks), [hooks](/concepts/hooks), and [multi-tenancy](/concepts/multi-tenancy) before setting up webhook handlers.

## Setup

Configure your webhook endpoint to handle Google Calendar events:

```ts title="app/api/webhook/route.ts"
import { processWebhook } from "corsair";
import { corsair } from "@/server/corsair";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
    const headers = Object.fromEntries(request.headers);
    const body = await request.json();
    
    const result = await processWebhook(corsair, headers, body);
    return result.response;
}
```

description: Database entities and querying synced PostHog data.
---

The PostHog plugin automatically syncs data from PostHog to your database. This allows you to query PostHog data without making API calls, providing faster access and offline capabilities.

## Synced Entities

The PostHog plugin syncs the following entities to your database:

- **events** - Tracked events

## Database API

Access synced data through the `db` property:

```ts
const events = await corsair.posthog.db.events.search({
    data: { event: "purchase" },
});
```

## Events

### Schema

```ts
{
    id: string;
    event: string;
    distinct_id: string;
    timestamp?: string;
    uuid?: string;
    properties?: Record<string, any>;
    createdAt?: Date | null;
}
```

### Querying Events

**Search by event name:**

```ts
const events = await corsair.posthog.db.events.search({
    data: { event: "purchase" },
});
```

**Search by user:**

```ts
const userEvents = await corsair.posthog.db.events.search({
    data: { distinct_id: "user-123" },
});
```

See [Database](/concepts/database) for more information about database concepts and querying patterns.

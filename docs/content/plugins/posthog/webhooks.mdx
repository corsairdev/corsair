description: All available PostHog webhook events and how to handle them.

The PostHog plugin automatically handles incoming webhooks from PostHog. Point your PostHog webhook URL to your Corsair webhook endpoint, and the plugin will automatically process events and update your database.

<Callout type="info">
**New to Corsair?** Learn about core concepts like [webhooks](/concepts/webhooks), [hooks](/concepts/hooks), and [multi-tenancy](/concepts/multi-tenancy) before setting up webhook handlers.

**Full Implementation:** For the complete, up-to-date list of all webhook events and their implementations, see the [PostHog plugin source code](https://github.com/corsairdev/corsair/tree/main/packages/corsair/plugins/posthog) on GitHub.

## Setup

Configure your webhook endpoint to handle PostHog events:

```ts title="app/api/webhook/route.ts"
import { processWebhook } from "corsair";
import { corsair } from "@/server/corsair";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
    const headers = Object.fromEntries(request.headers);
    const body = await request.json();
    
    const result = await processWebhook(corsair, headers, body);
    return result.response;
}
```

In your PostHog dashboard, set the webhook URL to:

```
https://your-domain.com/api/webhook
```

## Available Webhooks

### captured

`events.captured`

Fires when an event is captured in PostHog.

**Example Usage:**

```ts title="corsair.ts"
posthog({
    webhookHooks: {
        events: {
            captured: {
                after: async (ctx, result) => {
                    console.log("Event captured:", result.data.event);
                },
            },
        },
    },
})
```

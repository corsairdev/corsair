description: All available Google Drive webhook events and how to handle them.

The Google Drive plugin automatically handles incoming webhooks from Google Drive. Configure Google Drive push notifications to receive real-time updates when files or folders change.

<Callout type="info">
**New to Corsair?** Learn about core concepts like [webhooks](/concepts/webhooks), [hooks](/concepts/hooks), and [multi-tenancy](/concepts/multi-tenancy) before setting up webhook handlers.

## Setup

Configure your webhook endpoint to handle Google Drive events:

```ts title="app/api/webhook/route.ts"
import { processWebhook } from "corsair";
import { corsair } from "@/server/corsair";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
    const headers = Object.fromEntries(request.headers);
    const body = await request.json();
    
    const result = await processWebhook(corsair, headers, body);
    return result.response;
}
```

The Resend plugin automatically handles incoming webhooks from Resend. Point your Resend webhook URL to your Corsair webhook endpoint, and the plugin will automatically process events and update your database.

<Callout type="info">
**New to Corsair?** Learn about core concepts like [webhooks](/concepts/webhooks), [hooks](/concepts/hooks), and [multi-tenancy](/concepts/multi-tenancy) before setting up webhook handlers.

**Full Implementation:** For the complete, up-to-date list of all webhook events and their implementations, see the [Resend plugin source code](https://github.com/corsairdev/corsair/tree/main/packages/corsair/plugins/resend) on GitHub.

## Setup

Configure your webhook endpoint to handle Resend events:

```ts title="app/api/webhook/route.ts"
import { processWebhook } from "corsair";
import { corsair } from "@/server/corsair";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
    const headers = Object.fromEntries(request.headers);
    const body = await request.json();
    
    const result = await processWebhook(corsair, headers, body);
    return result.response;
}
```

In your Resend dashboard, set the webhook URL to:

```
https://your-domain.com/api/webhook
```

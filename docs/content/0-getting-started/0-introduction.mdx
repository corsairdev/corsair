# Introduction

Corsair is the Vibe Coding SDK that lets you write natural language API operations that work seamlessly with your existing stack.

## Features

- **Natural Language Queries and Mutations**: Write `useCorsairQuery("all published posts with authors")` instead of complex SQL
- **Full Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript inference across your entire stack
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with Next.js, Hono, Vite, Express, and more (even more coming soon)
- **ORM Integration**: Supports Prisma and Drizzle (more coming soon)
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extend with Slack, Resend, Stripe, and custom integrations (way more coming soon)

## What It Looks Like

```tsx
// What your queries look like
const { data: posts } = useCorsairQuery(
  'all published posts with their authors and comments'
)

// What your mutations look like
const { mutate: createPost } = useCorsairMutation('create a new post')
```

Corsair translates your natural language into type-safe database operations, integrating with TanStack Query for seamless data fetching and mutations.

## Traditional vs Corsair

```tsx
// Traditional approach
const posts = await db.post.findMany({
  where: { published: true },
  include: {
    author: true,
    comments: true,
  },
})

// Corsair approach
const { data: posts } = useCorsairQuery(
  'all published posts with authors and comments'
)
```

Get started in minutes with your existing database schema and ORM.
